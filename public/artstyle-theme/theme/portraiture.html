        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">
            Portraiture, as a common Renaissance art theme, emphasizes on humanism and secularization 
            by depicting its muse in its truest form. This art theme was characterized by painting the 
            likeness of the subject by meticulously adding symbolism (e.g. clothing, objects, jewelry, 
            etc.) while mimicking the physical features with accuracy.  Additionally,  renaissance 
            artworks under Portraiture commonly adopt a three-quarter view as artists felt it was more 
            dynamic and “dramatic” to do so. Example: Lady with an Ermine by Leonardo Da Vinci.
