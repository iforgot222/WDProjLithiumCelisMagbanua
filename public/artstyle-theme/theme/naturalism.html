        <h1> Naturalism </h1>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">
            In Naturalism, artists and painters prioritized depicting the natural world with life-like 
            accuracy, especially with human anatomy (with nude subjects). Within this art theme, 
            realistic anatomy, mastery in perspective, and  precise shadows were praised. However, aside 
            from depicting humans, painters commonly focused on nature as a subject from the rise of 
            humanism during the renaissance. 
        </p>
        <h2> But what is the difference between Naturalism and Realism? </h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">
            While both styles focus on depicting reality, they differ in the philosophy that they convey 
            in art. Art under Naturalism typically emphasized on nature, landscapes, and people (in terms 
            of anatomy) while art under Realism emphasized on the hardships of the working class during 
            the Renaissance (focusing on the philosophy realism). Additionally, Realism was later 
            popularized in the 19th century in response to the Industrial Revolution.
