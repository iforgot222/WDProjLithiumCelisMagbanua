                <b><p>
                    Caravaggio was an Italian Painter born in Milan, Italy, on September 29, 1571 until passing later on July 18, 1610. 
                    As an artist, Caravaggio was known as a revolutionary painter for the time of the renaissance as, unlike other artists 
                    who depicted the idealization of humans and religious experience, he painted in intense realism and strong contrasts 
                    between light and dark, or namely chiaroscuro. He was one of the first painters to use and master the technique, 
                    chiaroscuro, which later became the inspiration for Baroque art. Additionally, he is known for the unsettling atmosphere 
                    and realism in his style in painting the stories of the bible. However, Caravaggio was not only limited to painting 
                    Biblical themes, but depictions of death and sexual themes– which made his works to be rejected and considered vulgar and 
                    controversial by the church. While the many oeuvres he created were seen as crude and sold for little, Caravaggio continued 
                    to paint in his own distinctive style, which was revolutionary in itself as no other artist was as bold as him. 
                </p></b>
                <p><b>
                    Caravaggio’s first major piece was The Fortune Teller, and was introduced as a new style to other Roman artists; albeit 
                    became the footprint for artistic ranges in Roman Art. Whilst, Caravaggio’s most famous work is The Calling Of Saint 
                    Matthew, depicting the biblical event when Jesus calls Saint Matthew to become his apostle (Caravaggio.org, n.d.).
