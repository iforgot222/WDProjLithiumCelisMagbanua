                <p>
                    Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, or simply Caravaggio, was an Italian Painter born in Milan, Italy, on September 29, 1571 until 
                    passing later on July 18, 1610. As an artist, Caravaggio was known as a revolutionary 
                    painter for the time of the renaissance as, unlike other artists who depicted the 
                    idealization of humans and religious experience, he painted in intense realism and 
                    strong contrasts between light and dark, or namely chiaroscuro. He was one of the first 
                    painters to use and master the technique, chiaroscuro, which later became the inspiration 
                    for Baroque art. Additionally, he is known for the unsettling atmosphere and realism in 
                    his style in painting the stories of the bible. However, Caravaggio was not only limited 
                    to painting Biblical themes, but depictions of death and sexual themes– which made his 
                    works to be rejected and considered vulgar and controversial by the church. While the many 
                    oeuvres he created were seen as crude and sold for little, Caravaggio continued to paint in 
                    his own distinctive style, which was revolutionary in itself as no other artist was as bold as 
                    him. Caravaggio’s first major piece was <em>The Fortune Teller</em>, and was introduced as a new style 
                    to other Roman artists; albeit became the footprint for artistic ranges in Roman Art. 
                    Whilst, Caravaggio’s most famous work is <em>The Calling Of Saint Matthew</em>, depicting the 
                    biblical event when Jesus calls Saint Matthew to become his apostle (Caravaggio.org, n.d.).

                <p>
                    Raffaelo Sanzio da Urbino, most known as Raphael, was a renowned Italian painter 
                    born in Urbino on April 6, 1483 and later on passed April 6, 1520. Raphael was the 
                    son of an architect and court painter, Giovanni Santi and was trained by him from 
                    a young age (raphaelart.org, n.d.). Upon his father’s death, he inherited his father’s 
                    studio and continued his work and was influenced by other painters in his time such 
                    as Titian and Leonardo da Vinci, whose techniques later on shaped his approach to art. 
                    These influences became evident in his career as an artist, as his artworks showed the 
                    depiction of the holy family and humanist ideals; along with his style that was the 
                    epitome of the High Renaissance, characterized by the depth, harmonious proportions, 
                    rich colors, and balanced compositions in his artworks. 
                        
                    Known for his paintings that were heavily influenced by the ideas of the High 
                    Renaissance and Mannerisms (Raphael Paintings, Bio, Ideas, n.d.), he showcased 
                    astonishing depth and lifelike texture to his paintings. Additionally, he showed 
                    masterful use in techniques such as sfumato modeling (which he had adapted from 
                    Leonard da Vinci), linear perspective, and pyramidal groupings that made his art 
                    resonate with its other elements. However, he was not only limited to humanist ideals, 
                    but also portrayed the divine victory of good over evil through dramatic religious 
                    imagery; often being angels triumphing over demons. Prominent artworks that convey                         
                    this message include <em>Saint Michael Vanquishing Satan</em>, and <em>St. Michael</em>.
