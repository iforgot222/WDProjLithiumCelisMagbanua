In each section or artstyle, a separate page will be linked to it which will include 1 or 2 featured artwork with interactive/clickable areas (e.g., zoom-in and text boxes for certain areas to provide an analysis) with other artworks shown under the featured one. A short paragraph definition and context will be included for each art styles' page (e.g., “What defines this art style?”) **#JS will be applied in this section**
3. **Artists:** This page provides a list of artists during the renaissance organized by country, with the most significant one having a context paragraph and the others under them. This will contain a portrait of the artist, their famous works, and a short biography.

5. **Quiz:** This page will contain a mini-quiz with 3 types: “Who made this artwork?”, “What is the title of this artwork?”, and basic trivia. This type will link to a separate page where the mini quiz will be conducted. **#JS will be applied in this section**

#### Note:
**How will JS be used?**
* For the Art Styles Page, simple JS coding would be applied on the clickable areas of the artwork to scale it or add effects.
* In the Quiz Page, JS coding would be implemented possibly through the use of if-statements or  generally decision statements. A point system will be added to determine the scores.
